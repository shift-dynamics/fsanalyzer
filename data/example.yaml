      `attachment_link` can be either `seat_stay_link` to specify a four-bar
      linkage with a virtual pivot, or `chain_stay_link` to specify a faux-bar
      with a fixed instant center

    The following frame names are added automatically and cannot be used
    as link names below - `bottom_bracket` and `top_of_head_tube`. 
    For convenience, the bottom_bracket.x and bottom_bracket.y 
    variables allow specifying dimensions relative to bottom bracket 
    location, which is added automatically based on the stack, reach and fork
    geometry.  This allows fixing suspension geometry relative to bottom bracket, 
    while experimenting with changing stack and reach dimensions. At 
    present, the front_triangle is the only link that supports an additional
    keyword to specify dimensions relative to another frame.
